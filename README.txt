CMPT 433 Assignment Two:

Jong Joon (JJ) Lee - 301346516
Xuan (Ken) Ni - 301267328

What is working:
- Creating a dynamic array with a random permutation of the numbers 1 thorugh the size of the array.
- Array is sorted by bubble sort
- Total number of arrays have been sorted
- Reading the Zen cape's potentiometer every second and receiving a number between 0 and 4095
- Converting the A2D reading to the proper array size
- Printing the new array size every time a new array size is calculated
- The Zen cape's two digit 14-segment display displays the POT value until a max of 99

What is not working:
- UDP Socket 
- We choose not to display the number of arrays that the program finished sorting in the previous second as the answer is consistently one and does not change. We choose to display the POT value to demonstrate the proper working of the the two digit 14-segment display. 
- The graphic display of the debugger. 

Note: We used a SDK other than Eclipse.
